Unfortunately, or fortunately the networking setup is complex on the cloud, its not enough to open ports on the instance and gateway.
Found an interesting tool to figure out my issue on the virtual network.

check ports listening:
ss -nltp

discovered through documentation and video that oracle also configure on the ip table so i went in here and copied the one ssh and allowed 8554 to start with.

I added the mediamtx.yml with publisher to the default location and tested the stream, stream now going to the server:
paths:
  cam:
    source: publisher

We have succesful webrtc from the server and the latency is excellent:
