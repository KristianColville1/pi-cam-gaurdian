Starting today off making a logo for the new frontend and generating a favicon based on the final design.
Giving myself 20 minutes and no more to do it and move on. Using photopea (free photoshop) and some flavicon pngs.

part 2. putting nginx onto the server and configuring HTTPS with backend and frontend.

installing nginx:
![1767357644381](image/02-01-2026/1767357644381.png)

I copied over the backend and frontend to the server:
![1767362518558](image/02-01-2026/1767362518558.png)

located the sites available folder in nginx webserver:
![1767362732554](image/02-01-2026/1767362732554.png)

I opened up ports 80 and 443 for http and https in oracle cloud default security list:
![1767363155246](image/02-01-2026/1767363155246.png)

manually edited the ip table for these ports:
![1767363276751](image/02-01-2026/1767363276751.png)

I added the configuration for nginx and named it pi-guardian and confirmed the static frontend loading properly:


```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pi-guardian.kcolville.com;

    root /home/ubuntu/pi-guardian/frontend/dist;  # Frontend static
    index index.html;

    # Serve frontend static files
    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    # Proxy API requests to backend Node app
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;   # Backend process
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    # logs
    access_log /var/log/nginx/pi-guardian.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/pi-guardian.error.log;
}

```

working properly on http:
![1767363826254](image/02-01-2026/1767363826254.png)

i installed certbot to get self signed ssl for site:
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y


configured certbot for the domain:
![1767365097249](image/02-01-2026/1767365097249.png)

went through certbot process and selected redirect to ssl option so it would overwrite my conf i wrote for it:
![1767365349025](image/02-01-2026/1767365349025.png)


i checked the file running nano and can see the acme challange and config is successful. it now directs to https:
![1767365433954](image/02-01-2026/1767365433954.png)

was having an issue loading

![1767365599435](image/02-01-2026/1767365599435.png)

went around to check the iptable and ports in security list and spotted a logical error accidently opening port 433 instead of 443 in the security list, ammended:



![1767365655244](image/02-01-2026/1767365655244.png)

the site is now working on https and redirects properly and has a letsencrypt ssl cert:
