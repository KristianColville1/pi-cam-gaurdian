# Part 1: Camera Feed Setup

**Goal:** Get the camera feed (h.264) continuously loaded so it can be pulled with low latency. Everything else is straightforward, but this is the tricky part.

## Solution: Named Pipes (mkfifo)

Came across a piping command that allows two separate processes: publishing and pulling.

The command is `mkfifo`. It differs from regular piping in that it can stay up as long as the system is up.

> "One process can open it as a reader, and the other as a writer."

## Concerns & Solutions

**Memory Concern:** If writing to a file continuously, what about memory? Continuous writing will cause the Pi to fall over.

- **Strategy:** Write to limited temporary storage

**Latency Concern:** Read speed is an issue. Requiring the file system to fetch data adds latency because it takes time to fetch.

- **Strategy:** Write to RAM - it's highly accessible and already loaded
