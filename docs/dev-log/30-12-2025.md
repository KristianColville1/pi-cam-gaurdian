Security will be added on refinement similar to normal ip cam formats requiring username:password/ip-port like url.

I started with trying to see what quick options may be available to access the stream remotely:

successfully pulling from ddns on port 8000. at the moment estimate 2 second delay which is fine until we refine.

tested pinging the domain to see what latency we were experiencing on the network level.

The latency is less than 1ms which suggests I am not breaking outside the router.

Going to get a server externally.

Looking into Oracle cloud free tier.
